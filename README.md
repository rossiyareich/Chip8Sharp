# Chip8Sharp
### A basic Chip-8 emulator on .NET 6!

> CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker. It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers in the mid-1970s. 
> CHIP-8 programs are run on a CHIP-8 virtual machine. It was made to allow video games to be more easily programmed for these computers, but CHIP 8 is still used today, 
> due to its simplicity, and consequently on any platform and its teaching of programming Binary numbers.

All Chip-8 applications included are open and available on https://github.com/mattmikolay/chip-8 and https://github.com/dmatlack/chip8

The emulator only supports native Chip-8, no SUPER-CHIP, no XO-CHIP. Simply write out your Chip-8 application's path on to `config.json` to load it in the emulator.
