# Chip8Sharp
### A basic Chip-8 emulator on .NET 6!

Credit goes to GiawaVideos on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCr-745lOvoWD4-5zbd26og) for his Chip-8 Interpreter in C# series. 

All Chip-8 applications included are open and available on https://github.com/mattmikolay/chip-8 and https://github.com/dmatlack/chip8

The emulator only supports native Chip-8, no SUPER-CHIP, no XO-CHIP. Simply write out your Chip-8 application's path on to `config.json` to load it in the emulator.
